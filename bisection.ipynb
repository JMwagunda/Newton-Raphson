    "\n",
    "Within a given tolerance and maximum number of iterations, this function employs the bisection method to locate the function's root. The root's location is in the range $[a, b]$. The tolerance and the maximum number of iterations are specified in the function.\n",
    "We start by defining a function $f(x)$ and its derivative $f'(x)$, as well as an initial guess for the root:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a function $f(x)$ that is continuous on the interval $[a,b]$ and let $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, i.e., $f(a) \\cdot f(b) < 0$. Then, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists at least one root of $f(x)$ in the interval $[a,b]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bisection method is a simple numerical algorithm for finding this root. It works by repeatedly dividing the interval $[a,b]$ in half and testing which half contains the root, until a sufficiently accurate estimate of the root is found. Specifically, the bisection method involves the following iterative equation for updating the guesses for the root:\n",

    "    c_k = \\frac{a_k + b_k}{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "where $c_k$ is the midpoint of the interval $[a_k, b_k]$. At each iteration $k$, the function $f(x)$ is evaluated at $c_k$, and the sign of $f(c_k)$ is used to determine which half of the interval contains the root. The interval is then updated accordingly, and the process is repeated until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.\n",
