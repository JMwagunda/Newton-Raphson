Consider the function $f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5$ and its derivative $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 2$.

Let $x_0 = 1$ be the initial guess for the root of $f(x)$.

The Newton-Raphson method is used to find the root of the function. The algorithm iteratively updates the value of $x_0$ using the following equation:

$$ x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} $$

If the absolute value of $f(x_1)$ is less than the tolerance level, then the algorithm terminates and the root is found.

Otherwise, the value of $x_0$ is updated to $x_1$ and the process continues.

Python code's implementation of Newton-Raphson method 

\begin{verbatim}
import timeit

def f(x):
    return x**3 - 2*x - 5

def df(x):
    return 3*x**2 - 2

x0 = 1
tolerance = 1e-6
max_iteration = 100

for i in range(max_iteration):
    fx = f(x0)
    dfx = df(x0)
    
    x1 = x0 - (fx / dfx)
    print(f"Iteration number:{i+1}")
    
    if abs(f(x1)) < tolerance:
        print(f"Root found at x = {x1:.2f}")
        print("Time taken is ", timeit.timeit())
        break
    else:
        x0 = x1
\end{verbatim}

The output of the Python code is printed to the console

This includes the iteration number, the root found, and the time taken to find the root.
